below are actions in prompt, that actually work:

1. read file called `stressable/utils.py`
2. show project structure
3. use pytest, write to file called `tests/test_utils.py` with unit tests for `stressable/utils.py`
4. run tests
5. if tests are passing go to next step, otherwise go to step 3
6. create a new branch with autogenerated name
7. commit changes with autogenerated commit message

# TODO

- [ ] currently there is hard-coded project root `PROJECT_ROOT = "/home/oskar/git/stressable"` it should be provided from CLI
- [ ] currently there is hard-coded file to test `stressable/utils.py` it also should be provided from CLI
- [ ] it does seem that bot doesnt care if tests are failing. Maybe it could be fixed?
- [ ] autogenerated names are bad
